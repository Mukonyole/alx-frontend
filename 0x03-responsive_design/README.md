As the number of mobile phone users on the internet increases, it has become more and more important for web designers to lay out content in ways that work well for a variety of screen sizes. Responsive web design, originally defined by Ethan Marcotte in A List Apart, is a design strategy that responds to users' needs and their devices' capabilities by changing a site's layout to suit the device being used. For example, a responsive site might show content in a single-column view on a phone, two columns on a tablet, and three or four columns on a desktop computer.
